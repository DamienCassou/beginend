** Summary

You might want to read the [[https://emacs.cafe/emacs/package/2017/08/01/beginend.html][introductory blog post]].

Redefine ~M-<~ and ~M->~ (or any key bound to ~beginning-of-buffer~ or
~end-of-buffer~) for some modes so that point moves to meaningful
locations. The real beginning and end of buffers (i.e., ~point-min~
and ~point-max~) are still accessible by pressing the same key again.

In particular, these modes are supported:

| *Mode*                | ~M-<~                   | ~M->~                      |
|-----------------------+-------------------------+----------------------------|
| *dired-mode*          | first file              | last file                  |
| *magit-status-mode*   | first section           | last section               |
| *message-mode*        | first body line         | last line before signature |
| *prog-mode*           | after initial comments  | before final comments      |
| *occur-mode*          | first match             | last match                 |
| *ibuffer-mode*        | first buffer            | last buffer                |
| *bs-mode*             | first buffer            | last buffer                |
| *vc-dir-mode*         | first interesting file  | last interesting file      |
| *recentf-dialog-mode* | first most recent file  | last most recent file      |
| *org-agenda-mode*     | first agenda item       | last agenda item           |
| *compilation-mode*    | first compilation error | last compilation error     |
| *notmuch-search-mode* | first thread            | last thread                |
| *elfeed-mode*         | first feed              | last feed                  |
| *prodigy-mode*        | first service           | last service               |

Finally, beginend does what you expect when your buffer is narrowed.

** Installing

Use [[http://melpa.org/][melpa]].

You can activate beginend for all modes it supports by customizing the
variable ~beginend-global-mode~ (~M-x customize-variable RET
beginend-global-mode RET~) or by adding this line to your
configuration file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(beginend-global-mode)
#+END_SRC

You can also decide to only activate beginend for some of its
supported major modes (e.g., through ~beginend-dired-mode~).

** Using

At this point, newly opened supported buffers will get improved
versions of ~M-<~ and ~M->~ (or any key bound to ~beginning-of-buffer~
or ~end-of-buffer~).

The following shows some screencasts. In each screencast, the cursor
is moved to the meaningful beginning and end and to the real beginning
and end.

Adding new modes is a matter of a few lines of code. For example,
these five lines (already included) define the behavior of beginend in
~org-agenda-mode~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(beginend-define-mode org-agenda-mode
  (progn
    (org-agenda-next-item 1))
  (progn
    (org-agenda-previous-item 1)))
#+END_SRC

The first ~progn~ is responsible for moving point to the meaningful
beginning of buffer. Before being executed, point is at the real
beginning of the buffer (i.e., ~point-min~). The expression
~(org-agenda-next-item 1)~ thus moves to the first agenda item.
Similarly, the second ~progn~ is responsible for moving point to the
meaningful end of buffer starting from real end (i.e., ~point-max~).
